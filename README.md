# Drone-Communication-Simulation-Webots
This project aims to simulate a scenario where a UAV is being used in a rescue operation  to detect a person in danger and communicates its position back to its base station. We have also simulated the data loss and corruption that occurs due to dense vegetation and other such obstacles. We have implemented a simple Long Range(LoRa) communication protocol using python as it is an ideal protocol to be used for low power data transmission, high penetration and long range of data communication. This approach aims to explore potential solutions to the challenges associated with using drones in rescue operations.
