# Drone-Communication-Simulation-Webots
This project aims to simulate a scenario where a UAV is being used in a rescue operation  to detect a person in danger and communicates its position back to its base station. The main focus is to tackle the problem of data loss and corruption caused in such cases due  to dense vegetation by simulating long range communication (LoRa protocol).
